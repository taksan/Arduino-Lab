- Every time a sequence of commands that sets angles is executed in a single cycle,
the paper bot should queue the commands and waits

Example:
	
In the next cycles, the queue will be consumed. 
While the queue has elements, no new commands should be accepted.

paperBot::cycleBegin
	setThrust(10)
	wait(20)
	setThrust(20)
	wait(15)
	setDirection(175)
	wait(30)

paperBot::cycleEnd

paperBot::cycleBegin
	rejects any new commands, process commands in the queue and dequeue them
paperBot::cycleEnd
...

- motor changes are dequeued and the next wait too, proccess
